# Project Setup

This document outlines the steps I took to setup my development environment and scaffold this project.

## Requirements

1. Python version 3.8 or above. I strongly recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#simple-python-version-management-pyenv) to manage python versions on your machine.
2. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage our project dependencies.
3. [Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) to run services our wagtail app depends on.
4. Git

## Scaffold Wagtail
1. Created folder to contain wagtail project and other relevant folders and files.
    ```bash
    mkdir wagtail-project
    cd wagtail-project
    ```
2. Initialized a git repository in `./wagtail-project`
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
3. Created `./.gitignore` and added contents you see
4. Initialized a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) project.  _(I said no to defining main and development dependencies interactively when responding to the prompts)_.
    ```bash
    poetry init
    ```
5. Installed Wagtail and generated project template
    ```bash
    poetry run add wagtail

    poetry run wagtail start mysite
    ```

## Setup Development Database

1. Created `./docker-compose.dev.yml` with the contents you see
2. Created a shell script to setup development database and made it executable
    ```bash
    mkdir dev-dataase
    touch dev-database/init.sh
    chmod +x dev-database/init.sh
    ```
3. Created `./.env.dev`
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres

    APP_DB_PASSWORD=mysite
    APP_DB_NAME=mysite
    APP_DB_USER=mysite
    ```
4. Started postgres docker compose service
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
    ```
